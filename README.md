## Description

[My Portfolio](https://dee-here.github.io/portfolio/)

The task was to build a portfolio site, that would adapt to different screen sizes and be responsive.
Media queries were used to handle layout changs as the screen size changes.

CSS variables were used to easily modify and keep the CSS maintainable.

The header was designed such that it always takes up all the viewport when the page first loads.
Users can use the navigation links in the header to easily access other sections on the page.

Flexbox was used to position and flow content around the page as the screen size changes.
Absolute positoning helped display the titles on the project tiles.

first-child selector helped make the size of the first project bigger.



## Usage
Use the links in the header to view the three sections of the portfolio Aboutme, Work and contact information.
Clicking on the images in the Work section will take the user to the live deployed site for that project. There are only 3 live projects deployed and place holders for 2 more future projects.
